#### Understand the industry standard

In the context of salary negotiation, the term “industry standard” refers to the typical or common range of salaries offered for a specific job role within a particular industry or sector in a given region. It represents the benchmark or average salary that professionals with a certain level of experience and expertise can expect to earn for a particular position. Understanding the industry standard can help you make an informed case for the compensation you believe you deserve based on your qualification and the prevailing market conditions.

#### Know your worth

Consider your education, experience, and skills when determining your worth. Be prepared to discuss specific accomplishments that demonstrate your worth. Be confident in your abilities and don’t be afraid to ask for what you think you deserve.

#### Prepare your talking points and practice

As you are developing negotiation notes, it might be helpful to answer the following question as a framework for your conversation: Why do you feel you deserve a higher salary than the one the employer is offering?
Practice negotiating with a friend or family member before the actual negotiation. This will help you feel more confident and prepared.

#### Dress formally

Always dress well for the occasion and be well groomed. It helps to invest in a good pair of formal clothes, shoes and a formal bag.

#### Be professional

During the meeting, stay confident, maintain calmness.
Remember to be professional and respectful throughout the negotiation process. Avoid making demands and instead make a case for why you think you deserve a higher salary.

#### Consider the entire package

Don’t just focus on the salary. Consider other benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans and other perks.

#### Be flexible

While it’s important to know your worth, it’s also important to be flexible. Consider other forms of compensation such as stock options, equity or additional vacation days.

#### Be prepared to walk away

If the employer is unwilling to meet your salary requirements, be prepared to walk away. It’s important to know your worth and not settle for less than you deserve.
